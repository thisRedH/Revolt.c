## About

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is highly experimental and most things dont work. Things will break!

Revolt.c is a small, experimental C89 API wrapper and client framework for the [Revolt chat](https://revolt.chat/) platform.
It is designed with a focus on minimal external dependencies while trying to be feature-complete.
A key feature of Revolt.c is its custom WebSocket implementation based on libcurl, developed due to the lack of suitable C89-compliant WebSocket libraries.
